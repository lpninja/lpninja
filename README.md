### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NodeJS & MongoDB, Express, NPM, python. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on blogs and learning MongoDB, python.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to/for help with open source projects related to solar energy.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about solar engineering, design, datalogging for solar power plants, IoT. Connecting databases to NFT's.
- ðŸ”¬ My current research is looking into GIS and #webGIS including using QGIS.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once rode my fixed gear bike from [Tokyo to Osaka](https://vimeo.com/user7005442) in 3 days and camped along the way in carparks, the bush and anywhere. I couldn't feel my hand for 2 months after this. It was awesome.
