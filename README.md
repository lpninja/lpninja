### Hi there 👋
I’m @lpninja

- 🔭 I’m currently working as DevOps and system adminstrator @Sunpulse. Sunpulse is making a solar power plant list website for all of the solar power plants in Japan (450,000+).
- 🍁 I'm currently learning about blockchain tracking methodologies including the use of Arkham finance, DUNE Analytics and using Python and Go to write some tools for these.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on blogs and learning MongoDB, python, mesh-networking, privacy technologies.
- 🤔 I’m looking to/for help with open source projects related to solar energy and mesh-networking which include adding privacy layers to them.
- 💬 Ask me about solar engineering, design, datalogging for solar power plants, off-chain data validation pipelines, secure element hardware, connecting databases to NFT's.
- 🔬 My current research is looking into GIS and #webGIS including using QGIS. I am also researching different mesh network technologies that are low power, low bandwidth. e.g. Meshtastic.
