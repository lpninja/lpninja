### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m @lpninja

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as DevOps and system adminstrator @Sunpulse. Dataloggers, IoT for @liquidstar-io
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NodeJS & MongoDB, Express, NPM. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on html, css, blogs.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with open source projects related to solar energy.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about solar engineering, design, datalogging for solar power plants, IoT. Connecting databases to NFT's.
- ðŸ”¬ My current research is understanding if Proof-of-Work is absolutely necessary or are there alternatives? I am still not convinced that Proof-of-Stake is an actual replacement for Proof-of-Work. This is due to the "nothing at stake" issue, and, the ability to print money in the central bank and use it to buy more stake in cryptocurrency. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once rode my fixed gear bike from [Tokyo to Osaka](https://vimeo.com/user7005442) in 3 days and camped along the way in carparks, the bush and anywhere. I couldn't feel my hand for 2 months after this. It was awesome.
- Appeciate bootstrapping and the struggle.
