- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on html, css, blogs.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with open source projects related to solar energy.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about solar engineering, design, datalogging for solar power plants, IoT. Connecting databases to NFT's.
- ðŸ”¬ My current research is understanding if Proof-of-Work is absolutely necessary or are there alternatives? I am still not convinced that Proof-of-Stake is an actual replacement for Proof-of-Work.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once rode from [Tokyo to Osaka](https://vimeo.com/user7005442) in 3 days and camped along the way. I couldn't feel my hand for 2 months after this.
